The Odin Project: Recipes
Introduction: This will be a HTML based project where I will build a basic recipe website. This project will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. At the end of this project I will have demonstrated HTML skills such as Elements, Tags, Working with Text, Lists, and Links and Images.
